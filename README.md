Game Plot: 

*You are a 20-something year old human. you've decided that you want to go out and become a Pokemon Trainer.
Without any knowledge on how to do so, you take a hike to the nearest patch of grass you can find, and start walking around aimlessly until you can encounter a wild Pokemon.
Unfortunately, you lost track of where you were wandering and ended up deep in a forest, all by yourself. You look inside of the backpack you brought with you for anything that could help you escape the forest.
After rummaging through your bag, you find nothing that could help you escape this situation you're in. you decide to try and backtrace your steps to get back home. but this is when something very odd happened.
You encounter a Pokemon! but this Pokemon is unlike anything you've seen in the past.
It has big yellow ears with long red tufts in them, glowing red eyes like you've never seen before, and a big bushy tail with a twig stuck in it.
You're totally allured by this Pokemon, and decide that now's your chance to become the Pokemon trainer you've always wanted to be!
You take a small rock off the ground, and chuck it at the Pokemon to get its attention.
The Pokemon then turns around and faces you. It takes the twig out of its tail and points it in your direction. You notice that the tip of the twig is now on fire! Now's your chance!*
